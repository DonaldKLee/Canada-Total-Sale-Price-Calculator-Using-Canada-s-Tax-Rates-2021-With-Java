# Canada-Total-Sale-Price-Calculator-Using-Canada-s-Tax-Rates-2021-With-Java

Note: This is my first ever Java project. This program calculates the total cost of an item using Canada's tax rates from 2021. Also note that this program was created in 2021, therefore the tax rates may differ from the current tax rates in Canada, resulting in this calculator to be inaccurate.

## How to use:

1. Run the program
2. You will be prompted to enter the cost of each item excluding taxes (do not include the "$" sign)
3. When you are done entering the costs of each item, enter in "0"
4. You will then be prompted to enter in the province or territory you are in (based on the number that corresponds to the location)
